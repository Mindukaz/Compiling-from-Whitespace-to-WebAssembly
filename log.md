# Project Log

## Week 1 - Start of 4th Year

I was being lazy :/

## Week 2 - Start of Semester 1 Classes

Date | Hours | Summary
-----|-----|-----
24/09/2018 | 1 | Created and and prepared github repository. Prepared dissertation template from moodle.
25/09/2018 | 1 | Planned out the project week by week. Started reading the tiger book for compilers. Installed Mendeley for reference management.
30/09/2018 | 3 | Created Hello World and Fibonacci in Whitespace. Created their respective programs in C++ aswell.

## Week 3

Date | Hours | Summary
-----|-----|-----
01/10/2018 | 3 | Figured out how to compile and run C++ programs in WebAssembly. Reaserched Whitespace interpreters and compilers. Reaserched languages similar to Whitespace, such as Forth and other esoteric langaues.
02/10/2018 | 1 | Documenting Reaserch / tools / implememntation choices / etc.
07/10/2018 | 8 | Started writing the whitespace to c++ 'converter'. Almost finished parsing the whitespace source code, having problems with stack manipulation commands. Somtimes the parsing stage tries to convert a very large binary string that does not exist in the source. Most likely failing to detect a new line, and reading in commands as part of a parameter. Also throwing a few synatx errors. Not sure if the code, or the source files have actaul sytax errors the the online interpreter ignores.

## Week 4

Date | Hours | Summary
-----|-----|-----
08/10/2018 | 7 | Found out there are 2 more commands for whitespace. Create a whitespace source file that runs all the commands. Refactored Whitespace converter/parser. Made it more readable and easier to debug. Fixed the whitespace parsing (i think). Wrote the C++ equivalent of whitespace instructions, and began writing the code that will generate the C++ source code that equivalent to a whitespace source.
09/10/2018 | 2 | Continued working on the whitespace translator/parser/toy compiler. Erro fixing, and more refactoring. Supervisor gave an idea on how to implement returning from subroutine calls.
13/10/2018 | 4 | Got the toy compiler/translator working and generating correct C++ source files. Removed all bugs (i think).

## Weeks 5 and 6

assessments, assessments and more assessments :/

## Week 7

Date | Hours | Summary
-----|-----|-----
29/10/2018 | 1 | Created the whitespace test suite repository and began populating it with simple test programs.

## Weeks 8, 9, 10 and 11

5 modules was a mistake........

## Week 12 - End of Semester

Date | Hours | Summary
-----|-----|-----
09/12/2018 | 3 | Populated the whitespace test suite with tests for each individual command in the langauge. Need to add more general, full program tests and take a closer look at the fibonacci program.

## Week 13

December lazyness at its worst

## Week 14

Date | Hours | Summary
-----|-----|-----
22/12/2018 | 2 | Background reading on compiler design.

## Week 15 - Christmas

Nope

## Week 16 - New Year

Also nope

## Week 17 - Start of Semester 2

Should be working on this..........

## Week 18

Date | Hours | Summary
-----|-----|-----
16/01/2019 | 2 | Started implementing a readable version of whitespace, to make it easier to write large whitespace programs
17/01/2019 | 5 | Finished the readable whitespace to whitespace translator. Started writing the actual compiler (finally) and integrated the readable whitespace translator into the compiler. This way I will be able to compile both whitespace source and readable whitespace source with the same program.
